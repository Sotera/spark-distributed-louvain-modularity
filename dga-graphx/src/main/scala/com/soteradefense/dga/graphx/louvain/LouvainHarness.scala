/**
  * Coordinates execution of the louvain distributed community detection process on a graph.
  *
  * The input Graph must have an edge type of Long.
  *
  * All lower level algorithm functions are in LouvainCore, this class acts to
  * coordinate calls into LouvainCore and check for convergence criteria
  *
  * Two hooks are provided to allow custom behavior
  * -saveLevel  override to save the graph (vertcies/edges) after each phase of the process
  * -finalSave  override to specify a final action / save when the algorithm has completed. (not nessicary if saving at each level)
  *
  * High Level algorithm description.
  *
  * Set up - Each vertex in the graph is assigned its own community.
  *  1.  Each vertex attempts to increase graph modularity by changing to a neighboring community, or reamining in its current community.
  *  2.  Repeat step 1 until progress is no longer made
  *         - progress is measured by looking at the decrease in the number of vertices that change their community on each pass.
  * If the change in progress is < minProgress more than progressCounter times we exit this level.
  *  3. -saveLevel, each vertex is now labeled with a community.
  *  4. Compress the graph representing each community as a single node.
  *  5. repeat steps 1-4 on the compressed graph.
  *  6. repeat until modularity is no longer improved
  *
  * For details see:  Fast unfolding of communities in large networks, Blondel 2008
